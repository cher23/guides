The coordinate plane is commonly associated with René Descartes. The plane consists of a horizontal x-axia and a vertical y-axis. 
Also known as Cartesian coordinates, the point (0, 0) marks the origin of the plane. Any point to the right or left of the origin has a positive or negative x-coordinate respectively. Correspondingly, any point above or below the origin has a positive or negative y value.
